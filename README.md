# Twitter Sample App using Ruby On Rails

This is a Twitter sample application developed mainly using Ruby on Rails Language which can be viewed on 
[*Heroku*](https://quiet-crag-23786.herokuapp.com)
and was created by [Ahmed Fouad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmedfouadelta/).

This application includes examples of all the major features of Rails, including models, views, controllers, templates, partials, 
filters, validations, callbacks, has_many/belongs_to and has_many :through associations, security, testing, and deployment.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
